#mutability of set
#name: Keerthana
#set is an unordered coolection of datatypes,the elements are write in {},it has no duplicates
#here we are discused whether the set in mutable or immutable 
#mutable - we can change the elements in it , immutable - we can't change the elements

s={'keerthana',20,56,89.99,'pooja'}
print(s)

#add                                   
s.add(234)
print(s)

#discard
s.discard(20)
print(s)

#remove
s.remove(56)                                  
print(s)                                

#set is allowing modifications to performing add,remove ,discard ..so set is mutable  

#indexing is not allowed in set , because set is unordered 
#set only stores immutable elements like list , even we can't store set in set becasue  set is mutable 
#set itself mutable 

Thank You
